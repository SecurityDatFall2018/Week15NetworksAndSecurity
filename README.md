# Week15NetworksAndSecurity (Wednesday, Friday)

The purpose with this week is, to provide you with the minimal basic knowledge about the TCP/IP stack and related network protocols (TCP, IP, DNS, DHCP and ARP), necessary to monitor network traffic and understand the possible attacks that can be made against these protocols.

## What to Install
Since most of you succeed in installing Virtual Box and Kali Linux last week, I will downgrade this from **red** to **green** since it will make the exercises for this week simpler to write (I only need to provide Linux-info).
So install Virtual Box and Kali Linux as explained [last week](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v7pbEsQ24a4B07UjtFP3_hywqMF7URCRSr9EgpD2bUE/edit?usp=sharing) before this lesson (remember to check the SHA256Sum for the kali-download)


## What to Read OR Watch
Read these sections from the [Wikipedia Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite)
- Key architectural principles
- The sections describing each layer - Link Layer, Internet Layer, Transport Layer, Application Layer

OR

Watch the first 43 minuttes of this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkNq4TrHP_U)

## Exercises
[Investigating TCP/IP, DNS and DHCP with Wireshark](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TWqiRRHUWRHJwSSt1riu84ErxndVuWE_VxXOz4gjhPI/edit?usp=sharing)

# Friday December 7 th.
Today we will focus on posible attacks that can be made against individual layers/protols. We will do this to increase our knowledge about network monitoring with Wireshark, and while doing this, introduce new penetration testing tools.
