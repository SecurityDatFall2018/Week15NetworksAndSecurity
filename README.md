# Week15NetworksAndSecurity

The purpose with this week is, to provide you with the minimal basic knowledge about the TCP/IP stack and related network protocols (TCP, IP, DNS, DHCP and ARP), necessary to monitor network traffic and understand the possible attacks that can be made against these protocols.

## What to Install
Since most of you succeed in installing Virtual Box and Kali Linux last week, I will downgrade this from **red** to **green** since it will make the exercises for this week simpler to write (I only need to provide Linux-info).
So install Virtual Box and Kali Linux as explained [last week](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v7pbEsQ24a4B07UjtFP3_hywqMF7URCRSr9EgpD2bUE/edit?usp=sharing) before this lesson (remember to check the SHA256Sum for the kali-download)
